This repository contains replication code for Schneider et al. 2022 "Assessing the affordability of nutrient-adequate diets". 

The following datasets are needed to replicate the analysis in the paper: 

CPIDataforCoNA - contains the market price data needed to compute the least-cost diets.
HHNeedsIndivLevel_r - contains household nutrient requirements (shared requirements) at the individual level. 
MalawiIHPS_DietQualCost_CoNAiCoNAseries_r - contains the least-cost diet results for individualized and shared diets at the monthly level over the full time series.
MalawiIHPS_DietQualCost_FoodHHExp - household food expenditure computed from household surveys. Data are at the food item level.
MalawiIHPS_DietQualCost_FoodNUT_HHExp - household food expenditure computed from household surveys. Data are at the food item by nutrient level.
MalawiIHPS_DietQualCost_HH_r - household survey data with the shared least-cost diet result in the month the household was surveyed. Data are at the household level.
MalawiIHPS_DietQualCost_iCoNA - household survey data with the individualized least-cost diet result in the month the household was surveyed. Data are at the household level.
MalawiIHPS_DietQualCost_PID_r - household survey data at the individual level, including nutrient requirements. 
MalawiIHPS_DietQualCost_seasonality - the dataset created in the analysis of the seasonality results following the replication code.
PPP_Denton - monthly level data to smooth international annual PPP price conversions over the year.

Replication code and all datasets to create the analysis datasets used in this paper are available on Harvard Dataverse.
